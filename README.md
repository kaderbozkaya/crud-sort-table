# crud-sort-table

<h1>JavaScript CRUD</h1>
<p>I created a project that can read the data you enter into a form and put it into a table. You can click on the table header(th) to sort the data alphabetically or numerically, and you can also edit or delete rows. The project also cleans the data in the form before putting it into the table.</p>
